Updated: 2024.04.11

Project Name: Acct_Score

Project and Work Product Description:  (should be 1 CONCISE paragraph, 3-7 sentences)
	• This solution helps companies identify the best potential customers based on their own understanding of their Ideal Customer Profile. The business can easily input custom attributes and their weights to calculate "best-fit" scores for known prospect accounts. The highest scoring accounts can be prioritized for sales and marketing efforts, saving time and money, and maximizing potential customer conversion. As a stand-alone, lightweight Python script, this solution decreases dependency on other sales and marketing tools, while offering ease of customized scoring criteria for different target market and business objectives. 
	
	• Problem and Solution Workflow Diagrams (2 flowcharts "AS-IS" and "TO-BE")


Description of Solution:  (should be CONCISE, 3-7 sentences)
	• Software functions for solving problem(s) step by step: Python script that will be able to intake custom ideal customer profile attributes like company size, geo, revenue, industry, etc via a GUI. The user can modify inputs for weighing attributes. Input csv file of account data to score the fit of them against the ideal customer profile attributes, output csv with scores.
 
	• Workflow diagram of future ("TO-BE") state (improved processes from your solution).
	• "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP) 1.0 delivered.  (V1.x delivered beyond MVP V1.0?)
	• Later MVP, i.e., v2, v3, vN+ functionality to be delivered? 
    • Additional requirements, Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), usability, etc. for later versions
